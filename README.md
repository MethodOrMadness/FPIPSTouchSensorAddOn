# FPIPSTouchSensorAddOn
an optional, semi-customizable board to add touch sensors to a funnyplaying AGB IPS screen ribbon, instead of using the SEL+R/L button combination

I havent yet built this, I cannot verify that it actually works as intended, for building and installation I suggest referring to the schematic file, as it contains some notes.
